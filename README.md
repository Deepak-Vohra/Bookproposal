## Overview

The book explains how to solve a Sudoku puzzle of any difficulty level algorithmically, or methodically. If you are a math puzzles aficionado, were you able to solve a Sudoku puzzle the last time you started to solve one? Are you easily stumped by a difficult Sudoku? Well, let Sudoku daunt you no more. The book explains how a Sudoku puzzle of any difficulty level can be solved methodically by using a flexible algorithm.  

The book Learn to Solve Sudoku Algorithmically takes a methodical approach to solving a Sudoku puzzle. The rationale for a methodical approach is that a lot of time gets wasted in trying to solve a Sudoku puzzle by a hit-and-miss approach. The book explains how a flexible algorithm can be used to solve any Sudoku puzzle. The book illustrates the algorithm by solving three Sudoku puzzles ranging from easy to difficult. The main theme of the book is a flexible algorithm. The objective of the book is to enable even a layperson who has never solved a Sudoku puzzle before to solve any Sudoku puzzle by following the flexible algorithm.  

Key benefits:
- Learn to solve a Sudoku puzzle of any difficulty level
- Use a methodical but flexible approach instead of a hit-and-miss approach
- All you need is a Sudoku puzzle, a pencil, and an eraser
